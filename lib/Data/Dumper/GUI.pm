=head1 NAME

Data::Dumper::GUI - just what Data::Dumper needed... a GUI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Data::Dumper::GUI;
   
   print Dumper(@variables);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Data::Dumper::GUI is a little like L<Data::Dumper>, but as well as printing
out a dump of the variables it is passed, it also shows them in a pretty
GUI with a tree view, allowing you to expand and collapse nodes, etc.

It has special secret sauce support for L<Moose> objects. (And for L<Moo>
objects too, if you make sure Moose is loaded before dumping them.)

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Data-Dumper-GUI>.
